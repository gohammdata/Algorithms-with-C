<h1>Numerical Methods and Reason Included in This</h1>

<p>
Have a huge interest in the field of mathematics in general. Using <i>Numerical Methods for Engineering and Science</i> to gain knowledge of the topic. Using C to write these methods. Each section will have a C program and a description by me of that method in an effort to learn the numerical method. The goal is to also optimize each method with a proper algorithm for optimal performance.
