<h1>Algorithm with C Family</h1>
<p>Originally was just going to make all algorithms in C, and still primarily will. However with C++'s inate OOP, will use C++ when it makes sense (and honestly most, if not all, C written here will be compatible as a .cpp). C++ is very nice too so I really don't mind using it here when needed.

Used the name "Family" as I might use C# for the graphics and image processing algorithms because I will have use for these algorithms more in an application where C# is being used. However, I do not like having the .NET framework and all the baggage of C# in my working directory for to just write algorithms out and not applications. Writing these out in C++ is more likely the route I will take, and optimize the algorithm in it; and when they will be used in another project in C# that requires the setup, use it then. In general, I am not keen on C# but know in other settings its great. For this repo, C/C++ should be good; afterall just testing my algorithms run times and optimizing the algorithm. Same goes for Objective-C.
